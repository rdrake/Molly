# Molly #

Molly is a product of my (Richard Drake) MSc research under the supervision of Dr. Ken Pu at UOIT.  The code is primarily written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org), and it makes heavy use of various Java libraries such as [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/).

## Contributors ##

Please see the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/rdrake/Molly/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) file for a listing of all contributors.

## License ##

Please see [LICENSE](https://github.com/rdrake/Molly/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for licensing terms.

## Documentation ##

Currently there is no documentation available.  Whenever any does become available, it will be available in several locations:

* `doc` - Any documents such as the thesis itself will be placed here.
* [Wiki](https://github.com/rdrake/Molly/wiki) - Project management materials will typically appear here.
* [Project Site](http://rdrake.github.com/Molly) - Project progress, updates, etc. will be posted here.

## Building/Using ##

An up-to-date copy of the source code can always be obtained using Git.

    git clone https://github.com/rdrake/Molly.git

It is unlikely that actual release tarballs will ever be produced.

This project makes use of the [Cake](http://clojure-cake.org/) build tool for Clojure source code.  In addition, [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) is used to automate many aspects of the project such as building documentation.

## Submitting Bugs ##

Please make use of the Github [issues](https://github.com/rdrake/Molly/issues) tracker to report bugs.  If you find and fix a bug, please submit a pull request.
