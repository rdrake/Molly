\chapter{Introduction}
	In this thesis, we are motivated by the following problems:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define a formal framework to describe data sets with relational structures and text components.
		\item Design a collection of expressive query operators for analyzing text relational data sets.
		\item Investigate implementation techniques to make the query operators performant for modern multi-core computers.
	\end{itemize}
