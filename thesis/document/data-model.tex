\Chapter{Background}{A Tale of Two Data Models}
\label{chap:tale-of-two-data-models}
	The term ``data model'' refers to a notation for describing data and/or information.  It consists of the data structure, operations that may be performed on the data, as well as a set of constraints placed on the data \cite{dbsys-06}.
	
	In this chapter we provide background and motivation for this thesis.  We provide a formal definition of the relational data model, discuss its merits, its shortcomings, and contrast it to the document data model.  The document model, contrary to the relational model, permits fast and flexible keyword search without requiring explicit domain knowledge of the data, such as the join path between two entities.
