\chapter{A Tale of Two Data Models}
The term ``data model'' refers to a notation for describing data and/or information.  It consists of the data structure, operations that may be performed on the data, as well as constraints placed on the data \cite{dbsys-06}.

In this chapter we provide a formal definition of the relational data model, discuss its merits, its shortcomings, and contrast it to the document data model.  Contrary to the relational model, the document model permits fast and flexible keyword search without requiring explicit domain knowledge of the data.  In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of encoding a relational model into a document model in a lossless manner.
