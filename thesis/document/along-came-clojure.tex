\chapter{Along Came Clojure}
\label{chap:along-came-clojure}
	In this chapter we discuss the implementation details of our system.  In \cref{sec:basic-principles-fp} we discuss the basic tenets of functional programming with an emphasis on how Clojure implements these tenets.  Further attention is paid to how Clojure uses these tenets to implement its concurrency model.
	
	In \cref{sec:search-with-clojure} we illustrate how Clojure's \gls{jvm} interoperability is used to interface with Lucene and \gls{jdbc} drivers in order to perform indexing and search on data.  This section also covers keyword as well as graph search in document space.
	
	In \cref{sec:web-interface} we present a simple web-based interface to the system.  It functions as a demonstration of the system's capabilities.
