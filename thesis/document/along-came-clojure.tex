\chapter{Along Came Clojure}
\label{chap:along-came-clojure}
	In this chapter we further discuss our implementation.  In \cref{sec:basic-principles-fp} we discuss the basic tenets of functional programming with an emphasis on how Clojure implements these tenets.  Further attention is paid to how Clojure uses these tenets to implement its concurrency model.
	
	In \cref{sec:search-with-clojure} we illustrate how Clojure's \gls{jvm} interoperability is used to interface with Lucene and \gls{jdbc} drivers in order to perform indexing and search on data.  This section also covers keyword as well as graph search in document space.
